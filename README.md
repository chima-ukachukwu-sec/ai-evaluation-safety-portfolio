# AI Evaluation, Safety & Red‑Teaming Portfolio

> **NDA‑Compliant Portfolio** — All materials below are generalized reconstructions demonstrating methodology and judgment. No proprietary prompts, datasets, tools, personas, or client identifiers are included.

---

## Overview

I am an **AI Evaluation & Safety Specialist** with experience across adversarial testing, safety governance, rubric calibration, and long‑context red teaming. This repository presents **four distinct project archetypes** that together demonstrate depth (technical rigor) and breadth (policy, governance, and human‑factors realism) while remaining fully NDA‑compliant.

**What this portfolio proves:**

* I can identify and reduce real‑world AI risk
* I design precise, low‑noise safety evaluations
* I operate within strict compliance and reviewer workflows
* I understand both offensive‑aware testing and defensive safety design

## Project Archetypes

### Project 1 — Adversarial AI Safety Testing & Data Exfiltration Risk
📄 [`project-archetypes/adversarial-ai-safety-testing.md`](project-archetypes/adversarial-ai-safety-testing.md)

**Focus:** Red‑team evaluation of privacy and data‑exfiltration risks using multi‑turn, context‑aware simulations.

**Highlights:**

* Multi‑step attack simulation (abstracted)
* Context accumulation and cross‑turn risk analysis
* Outcome classification (prevented / partial / failure)
* Controlled, sandboxed testing environments

**Key Skills:** Adversarial testing, privacy risk analysis, multi‑turn reasoning evaluation, structured reporting.

### Project 2 — AI Safety Governance, Risk Classification & Response Control
📄 [`project-archetypes/ai-safety-governance-risk-control.md`](project-archetypes/ai-safety-governance-risk-control.md)

**Focus:** Dataset labeling and governance to determine when models should respond, uplevel, or refuse cybersecurity‑related requests.

**Highlights:**

* Capability‑level classification (conceptual → operational)
* Kill‑chain–aligned risk analysis
* Response governance decisions (respond / uplevel / refuse)
* Reviewer‑facing safety justifications

**Key Skills:** AI safety governance, policy enforcement, risk classification, dataset QA.

---

### Project 3 — Harm-Precision Rubric Design & Review Calibration
📄 [`project-archetypes/harm-precision-rubric-governance.md`](project-archetypes/harm-precision-rubric-governance.md)

**Focus:** Designing and refining safety rubrics to minimize false positives while preserving strong harm detection.

**Highlights:**

* Precision harm attribution (material enablement only)
* False‑positive reduction
* Multi‑step expert review loops
* JSON‑formatted rubric standards

**Key Skills:** Rubric design, calibration, reviewer alignment, quality governance.

---

### Project 4 — Authentic Long-Context Red Teaming & Persona-Based Evaluation
📄 [`project-archetypes/long-context-authentic-red-teaming.md`](project-archetypes/long-context-authentic-red-teaming.md)

**Focus:** Stress‑testing models in long, realistic conversations to surface safety failures that appear only over extended context.

**Highlights:**

* Persona consistency and emotional‑arc modeling
* Gradual escalation and refusal‑adaptation testing
* Context accumulation and memory pressure
* Wellbeing‑aware red‑teaming practices

**Key Skills:** Long‑context evaluation, human‑factors safety, realism enforcement, trend analysis.
