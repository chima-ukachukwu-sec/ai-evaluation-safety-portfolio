# QA Checklist (NDA-Safe)

Use this checklist before submitting evaluations, labels, or reviews.

## Scoring Integrity
- [ ] Scores match the written justification
- [ ] No assumptions beyond the provided content
- [ ] Harm is attributed only when it is materially enabling (not theoretical prerequisites)

## Safety & Policy
- [ ] Response strategy is appropriate: Respond / Uplevel / Refuse
- [ ] Refusals are firm and do not include unsafe details
- [ ] Privacy risks are handled cautiously (no sensitive data exposure)

## Consistency & Format
- [ ] Persona/context is consistent across turns (if long-context)
- [ ] Required fields are present (JSON keys, labels, etc.)
- [ ] Output matches formatting rules (spelling, structure, constraints)

## Final Sanity Check
- [ ] Would this withstand a reviewer audit?
- [ ] Is this clear to someone who didn’t see the full conversation?
- [ ] Does it avoid proprietary terms, tool names, and client identifiers?

## NDA Notice
This checklist is a generalized, non-proprietary template for quality control.
