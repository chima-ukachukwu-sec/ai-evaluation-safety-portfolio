# Time Tracking Best Practices (Contract Work)

## Goal
Maintain accurate, defensible time logs that match observable activity and platform expectations.

---

## Core Principles
- **One project at a time**: never overlap timers across projects
- **Timer = visible work**: if the system can’t see engagement, it may count as idle
- **Pause aggressively**: breaks, thinking, reading long docs, or stepping away should be off-timer

---

## When to Start the Timer
Start only when:
- Task is loaded and you’re ready to actively work
- You are about to type, review, or submit within the task environment

Avoid starting timer for:
- Searching for references
- Reading long instructions
- Waiting for tasks to load

---

## When to Pause / Stop
Pause immediately if:
- You switch away from the task tab for a meaningful time
- You’re thinking longer than ~30–60 seconds without interaction
- You step away (even briefly)
- Technical issues occur

Stop when:
- The task is complete
- The queue is empty
- You’re unsure how to proceed

---

## Consistency Habits
- Take short breaks to reduce fatigue and idle flags
- Keep daily hours realistic and consistent
- Avoid large retroactive edits; log time in-session when possible

---

## Documentation Hygiene
- Use short, factual notes (e.g., “Rubric evaluation + justification writing”)
- Never include sensitive client/project identifiers in time notes
- Keep a private personal log for your own records (dates + hours + general work type)
