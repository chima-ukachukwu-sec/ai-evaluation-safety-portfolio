# Project 3 — Harm-Precision Rubric Design & Review Calibration

## Overview
Designed and refined AI safety rubrics with an emphasis on precision,
ensuring harm is attributed only when responses materially lower
real-world risk barriers.

## Core Focus
- False-positive reduction
- Precision harm attribution
- Expert review workflows
- Rubric lifecycle management

## Abstracted Workflow
1. Define harm criteria aligned to material enablement
2. Review scored conversations for over-attribution
3. Identify and remove false positives
4. Refine rubric elements
5. Re-run evaluations and repeat calibration
6. Maintain strict formatting standards

## Skills Demonstrated
- Rubric design & calibration
- Quality governance
- Reviewer alignment
- Safety evaluation precision

## NDA Notice
Rubrics are reconstructed at a high level and do not reflect
proprietary scoring systems or internal taxonomies.
