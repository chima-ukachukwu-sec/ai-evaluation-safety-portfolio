# Project 2 — AI Safety Governance, Risk Classification & Response Control

## Overview
Contributed to AI safety governance efforts focused on classifying cybersecurity-
related requests and determining appropriate model responses under policy constraints.

## Core Focus
- Risk-based response control
- Capability-level classification
- Kill-chain aligned analysis
- Dataset quality assurance

## Abstracted Workflow
1. Assess requested capability level (conceptual → operational)
2. Identify contextual risk factors
3. Map content to threat categories
4. Decide response strategy (respond, uplevel, refuse)
5. Write reviewer-facing justifications
6. Iterate based on quality feedback

## Skills Demonstrated
- AI safety governance
- Policy enforcement
- Risk classification
- Safety dataset labeling

## NDA Notice
All classifications and workflows are generalized and do not expose
internal schemas, prompts, or tools.
